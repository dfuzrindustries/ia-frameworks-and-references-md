## Overview

The Business Canvas is a collaborative strategic mapping session that creates the foundational clarity required for successful AI transformation. This framework integrates two critical dimensions:

1. **Strategic Foundation**: VMP, brand identity, culture, OKRs, business model, and competitive positioning
2. **AI Readiness Assessment**: Data availability, technical infrastructure, process maturity, change capacity, and business impact potential

By mapping these dimensions simultaneously, organizations ensure AI investments align with strategic objectives, organizational values, and actual capabilities.

## PART 3: INTEGRATION & ALIGNMENT

### Strategic-to-AI Alignment Matrix

Map strategic priorities against AI readiness dimensions to identify:
- **High Priority + High Readiness** = Immediate action
- **High Priority + Low Readiness** = Foundation building required
- **Low Priority + High Readiness** = Quick wins, but not strategic
- **Low Priority + Low Readiness** = Defer or deprioritize

**Canvas Output**: 2x2 priority matrix

---

### AI Investment Prioritization

Rank potential AI initiatives using this formula:

**Priority Score** = (Strategic Value × Readiness Score × Impact Potential) / (Effort × Risk)

Where:
- **Strategic Value**: 1-5 (alignment to top priorities)
- **Readiness Score**: Dimension-specific score (1-5)
- **Impact Potential**: Expected ROI or outcome improvement (1-5)
- **Effort**: Implementation complexity (1-5, inverse scoring)
- **Risk**: Technical, organizational, compliance risk (1-5, inverse scoring)

**Canvas Output**: Ranked initiative backlog

---

### Gap Remediation Roadmap

For each low-scoring dimension (< 3), define:
1. **Current State**: What's missing or broken
2. **Target State**: Required capability level
3. **Gap Actions**: Specific initiatives to close gap
4. **Timeline**: Realistic timeframe (30/60/90 days)
5. **Owner**: Functional leader responsible
6. **Success Metrics**: How to measure progress

**Canvas Output**: 90-day gap closure plan
