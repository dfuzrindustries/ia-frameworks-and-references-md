## Overview

The Business Canvas is a collaborative strategic mapping workshop that establishes foundational clarity on vision, mission, purpose, brand identity, culture, strategic priorities, and business model. This framework creates the strategic alignment required for any organizational transformation or growth initiative.

**Purpose**: Establish strategic foundation and organizational clarity

**Duration**: 4-6 hour facilitated workshop

**Participants**: Executive team, functional leaders, key stakeholders

**Outcome**: Documented strategic foundation with visual artifacts and alignment on priorities

## Why Business Canvas First?

Organizations cannot execute transformation without strategic clarity. The Business Canvas ensures:

- **Alignment**: Leadership aligned on VMP, priorities, and values
- **Foundation**: Clear strategic baseline before operational work begins
- **Decision Framework**: Principles that guide investment and prioritization
- **Cultural Context**: Understanding of organizational readiness for change
- **Business Model Clarity**: Explicit understanding of value creation and capture

**Key Principle**: Strategy must be documented, measurable, and operationally connected.

- Focus on alignment, not consensus
- Document decisions and open questions in real-time

### Post-Workshop
- Synthesize outputs into clean deliverables within 3-5 days
- Schedule follow-up for questions/refinements
- Share with broader organization as appropriate

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**→ Operational Canvas**: Strategic priorities inform which value streams to optimize

**→ Workflow Prioritization**: VMP and OKRs guide workflow selection criteria

**→ AI Readiness Assessment**: Strategic priorities determine assessment focus areas

**→ Maturity Model**: Culture and change readiness inform maturity advancement strategy

**→ KPI Architecture**: Strategic priorities cascade into functional and operational KPIs

## Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Lack of Strategic Clarity
**Symptom**: No documented VMP or conflicting statements
**Solution**: Use workshop to create VMP from scratch, validate through iteration

### Challenge 2: Culture-Strategy Misalignment
**Symptom**: Desired strategy conflicts with current culture
**Solution**: Explicitly map culture gaps and build evolution roadmap

### Challenge 3: Too Many Priorities
**Symptom**: 10+ "top priorities" identified
**Solution**: Force-rank using impact and resource constraints

### Challenge 4: Vague OKRs
**Symptom**: Objectives without measurable key results
**Solution**: Apply SMART criteria to every key result

### Challenge 5: Disconnected Business Model
**Symptom**: Operations don't match stated strategy
**Solution**: Map current vs. desired state and build transition plan

*The Business Canvas establishes the strategic foundation required for any transformation initiative - without clarity on VMP, priorities, and business model, operational improvements lack direction and purpose.*
