## Overview

This framework defines Intelligent Agency's internal standards for what qualifies as a workflow and how workflows are identified, designed, implemented, and measured. These standards ensure rigorous, consistent workflow delivery across all client engagements and product development.

**Audience**: Internal IA consultants and practitioners

**Purpose**: Maintain workflow quality, economic rigor, and system-level thinking

**Usage**: Reference during POV, POC, Pilot, and Program phases

---

## PART 1: WORKFLOW DEFINITION STANDARD

### Purpose

This standard defines what Intelligent Agency means by a *workflow* and establishes the definitive criteria for workflow qualification.

This standard is used across Intelligent Agency for:
- Product development
- Client engagements
- Roadmap prioritization
- Economic impact reporting
- Intelligent OS maturity assessment

**Governing Principle**: If something does not meet this definition, it is not treated as a workflow within Intelligent OS.

---

### What Is a Workflow?

At Intelligent Agency, a workflow is:

> **A repeatable, end-to-end business process that converts inputs into outcomes through a defined sequence of decisions and actions, and whose economic impact can be measured.**

A workflow is **not**:
- A feature
- A tool
- A task list
- A one-off automation
- A slide-level use case

A workflow exists only when it can be:
- Executed repeatedly
- Owned by the business
- Measured economically
- Operated with or without AI assistance

---

### Required Characteristics of a Workflow

Every workflow must meet **all** of the following criteria.

#### 1. Clear Trigger
A defined event or condition that initiates the workflow.

**Examples**:
- A customer request is submitted
- A forecast variance exceeds tolerance
- A contract reaches renewal window

---

#### 2. Defined Inputs
The data, context, or signals required to execute the workflow.
Inputs may be structured or unstructured, human- or system-generated.

---

#### 3. Decision Logic
The rules, judgments, or reasoning applied during execution.
This may include:
- Human decisions
- AI-assisted decisions
- Fully automated decisions

---

#### 4. Actions & Outputs
Concrete actions taken and outputs produced, such as:
- Reports
- Recommendations
- Transactions
- Approvals
- Customer communications

---

#### 5. Business Owner
A named role accountable for workflow performance and outcomes.
Ownership cannot be delegated to "the system."

---

#### 6. Repeatability
The workflow must be executed across time and cases, and ideally across teams or clients.

---

#### 7. Economic Impact
The workflow must produce one or more of the following:
- Time savings
- Cost reduction
- Revenue increase
- Risk reduction (with quantified proxy)

**Critical Rule**: If economic impact cannot be defined, the workflow does not qualify.

---

### Workflow System Fit

In addition to delivering local economic impact, every workflow must be assessed for how it integrates with and improves the broader organization.

**Workflow System Fit** evaluates how a workflow:
- Interacts with other workflows
- Affects upstream and downstream processes
- Contributes to enterprise-wide objectives
- Improves the organization's overall ability to execute strategy

**Anti-Pattern**: A workflow that produces local gains but degrades system performance does not meet Intelligent Agency's standard.

---

#### Required System Fit Criteria

Every workflow definition must explicitly document:

**1. Upstream Dependencies**
- Which workflows, teams, or systems provide inputs
- Sensitivity to upstream variability or delays

**2. Downstream Effects**
- Which workflows or teams consume outputs
- Changes to timing, quality, or volume of downstream work

**3. Cross-Functional Impact**
- Functions affected (e.g., Product, Sales, Finance, Operations)
- Whether handoffs are reduced, unchanged, or increased

**4. Decision & Incentive Alignment**
- Whether the workflow reinforces shared goals and KPIs
- Whether it introduces conflicting incentives or measurements

**5. Enterprise Goal Contribution**
- Which enterprise-level objectives the workflow supports
- How it strengthens the organization's operating capability

---

#### System Fit Requirement

A workflow may only advance beyond POV if:
- Its system interactions are understood
- Its net effect on the organization is positive or neutral
- Any tradeoffs are explicit and accepted

---

### Workflow Phases

Workflows progress through four phases:

- **POV** — Defined and prioritized
- **POC** — Prototyped and validated
- **Pilot** — Operating in production with real users
- **Program** — Scaled, governed, and sustained

**Critical Rule**: Progression requires evidence, not intent.

---

### Relationship to Intelligent OS

Every workflow activates one or more Intelligent OS layers:
- Workflow Layer
- Agent Layer
- Orchestration Layer
- Intelligence Layer
- CEO Synthesis Layer

Workflows are the mechanism through which Intelligent OS delivers value.

---

### Relationship to the North Star

All workflows roll up to IA's North Star:

> **Production workflows with verified dollars saved or earned**

This ensures alignment across Product, Delivery, Sales, and Leadership.

---

### Governing Principle

> If a workflow cannot be clearly defined, owned, measured economically, and shown to improve the broader system, it does not belong in Intelligent OS.

---

## PART 2: WORKFLOW PRACTITIONER PLAYBOOK

### Overview

This playbook provides step-by-step guidance for practitioners to identify, design, validate, and scale workflows according to Intelligent Agency standards.

---

### Step 1: Identify Workflow Candidates

**Objective**: Find repeatable processes with measurable business impact potential.

**How to Identify**:
1. Review operational pain points from Business Canvas and Operational Canvas workshops
2. Analyze value stream bottlenecks and friction points
3. Interview business owners about repetitive, high-effort processes
4. Review existing SOPs and process documentation
5. Examine workflows already flagged in the Opportunity Backlog

**Qualification Test**:
- Does it meet all 7 Required Characteristics?
- Can economic impact be quantified?
- Is there a clear business owner?

---

### Step 2: Document Current State

**Objective**: Establish baseline understanding and measurement foundation.

**Required Documentation**:

**2.1 Workflow Overview**
- Workflow name
- Business owner (named role)
- Primary function
- Trigger event
- Current frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)

**2.2 Process Steps**
- Detailed step-by-step documentation
- Decision points and logic
- Handoffs between people/teams
- Systems and tools used
- Data inputs and outputs

**2.3 Current State Metrics**
- Cycle time (end-to-end)
- Manual hours required
- Error rate / rework frequency
- Cost per execution
- Volume per time period

**Critical Rule**: If a baseline cannot be established, the workflow cannot advance.

---

### Step 3: Assess System-Level Impact

**Objective**: Prevent local optimization and ensure enterprise value.

Before forming the economic impact hypothesis, practitioners must assess how the workflow interacts with the broader organization.

---

#### 3.1 System Mapping

Identify:
- **Upstream workflows** that supply inputs
- **Downstream workflows** that consume outputs
- **Parallel workflows** affected by timing or data changes
- **Shared resources** impacted (people, data, systems)

This creates a simple workflow interaction map.

---

#### 3.2 System Impact Assessment

For each affected area, assess:
- Will this workflow reduce or increase coordination effort?
- Will it shift work or bottlenecks elsewhere?
- Will it improve decision quality across functions?
- Will it alter incentives or performance measures?

---

#### 3.3 System Impact Rating (Required)

Each workflow must receive a rating:

- **Positive**: Improves performance across multiple workflows or functions
- **Neutral**: Local improvement with minimal system effect
- **Negative**: Creates friction or degradation elsewhere

**Critical Rule**: Workflows with negative system impact cannot advance without redesign.

---

#### 3.4 Enterprise Goal Alignment

Explicitly document:
- Which enterprise goals this workflow supports
- How its outcomes roll up to executive-level metrics

---

### Step 4: Form the Economic Impact Hypothesis

**Objective**: Define how the workflow will create measurable value.

**Impact Types**:
- **Efficiency**: Time or cost reduction
- **Growth**: Revenue increase or acceleration
- **Risk**: Loss avoidance or compliance improvement

**Example Hypothesis**:
> "Automating this workflow will reduce cycle time by 40%, saving ~1,200 hours annually and ~$180K in fully loaded cost."

**Critical Rule**: Hypotheses must be testable and falsifiable.

---

### Step 5: Design the Target Workflow

**Objective**: Define the AI-augmented future state.

Design the future-state workflow:
- Which decisions are AI-assisted?
- Which actions are automated?
- Where humans remain accountable?

Explicitly define:
- Human-agent interaction points
- Escalation paths
- Governance checkpoints

---

### Step 6: Select KPIs & Measurement Method

**Objective**: Establish success criteria and measurement approach.

Each workflow must define:
- Primary economic KPIs
- Supporting operational KPIs
- Measurement cadence

**Required KPIs**:
- Dollars saved or earned
- Time-to-value
- Adoption rate

**Measurement Method**:
- Data collection approach
- Baseline comparison methodology
- Reporting frequency

---

### Step 7: Validate in POC / Pilot

**Objective**: Prove value with real data and real users.

During POC and Pilot:
- Compare results to baseline
- Track variance from hypothesis
- Capture qualitative feedback
- Validate adoption with real users
- Document blockers and friction

**Critical Rule**: Economic impact must be demonstrated with real data, not projected.

---

### Step 8: Verify & Report Impact

**Objective**: Confirm sustained value delivery and communicate results.

Impact is verified when:
- Measured against baseline
- Sustained over a defined period
- Approved by the workflow owner

Verified impact is reported to:
- Roadmap
- Scorecard
- Executive stakeholders

---

### Step 9: Graduate or Retire

**Objective**: Make data-driven decisions about workflow progression.

Using graduation criteria:
- **Advance** successful workflows to next phase
- **Redesign** workflows not meeting targets
- **Retire** workflows that fail to demonstrate value

**Cultural Principle**: There is no penalty for retiring a workflow early. Early termination of low-value work is success, not failure.

---

### Practitioner Responsibilities

Every IA practitioner is responsible for:
- Upholding the workflow definition standard
- Enforcing economic measurement rigor
- Preventing local optimization
- Making system effects explicit
- Escalating tradeoffs when needed
- Documenting learnings for future workflows

---

### Guiding Principle

> Our credibility is earned by the workflows we put into production and the economic impact they deliver across the entire organization.

---

## PART 3: WORKFLOW SYSTEM MAP TEMPLATE

### Purpose

The Workflow System Map documents how a workflow integrates with the broader organization and how it contributes to overall system performance.

This template is required for all workflows advancing beyond POV and is used to:
- Prevent local optimization
- Reveal upstream and downstream dependencies
- Surface cross-functional impacts
- Ensure workflows contribute to enterprise goals
- Support governance and graduation decisions

**Critical Rule**: A workflow that cannot be mapped at the system level does not meet Intelligent Agency's standard.

---

## Quality Assurance

### Red Flags (Do Not Advance)

- ✗ Unclear business owner
- ✗ No economic impact hypothesis
- ✗ Baseline cannot be established
- ✗ Negative system impact without mitigation
- ✗ Missing System Map documentation
- ✗ Unclear progression criteria

### Green Lights (Ready to Advance)

- ✓ All 7 Required Characteristics met
- ✓ Economic impact quantified and testable
- ✓ System Map completed and reviewed
- ✓ Positive or neutral system impact rating
- ✓ Baseline metrics documented
- ✓ Clear business owner assigned

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Feature Disguised as Workflow
**Problem**: Treating a product feature as a workflow
**Solution**: Apply repeatability and business ownership tests

### Pitfall 2: Local Optimization
**Problem**: Improving one area while degrading another
**Solution**: Complete System Map and assess cross-functional impacts

### Pitfall 3: Unmeasurable Impact
**Problem**: Vague benefits without quantification
**Solution**: Require specific, testable economic hypotheses

### Pitfall 4: No Business Owner
**Problem**: IT or Product "owns" the workflow
**Solution**: Identify the functional leader accountable for outcomes

### Pitfall 5: Skipping Baseline
**Problem**: Moving to POC without current-state measurement
**Solution**: Document baseline before any design work

---

## Success Metrics for Workflow Standards

These standards succeed when:

**Quality Indicators**:
- >90% of workflows advancing to Pilot demonstrate positive ROI
- >80% of workflows graduating to Program remain in production
- <20% of workflows retired in POC phase (indicating good POV filtering)

**System Indicators**:
- Workflows show positive or neutral system impact ratings
- Cross-functional friction decreases over time
- Enterprise KPIs improve as workflows scale

**Cultural Indicators**:
- Practitioners consistently apply standards without enforcement
- Teams proactively document system effects
- Early workflow retirement is celebrated, not stigmatized

---

## Document Maintenance

These standards are living documents and should be updated based on:
- Field learnings from client engagements
- Product evolution and new capabilities
- Practitioner feedback and suggestions
- Competitive intelligence and market changes

**Update Cadence**: Quarterly review, annual refresh

**Owner**: Chief Product Officer + Head of Delivery
