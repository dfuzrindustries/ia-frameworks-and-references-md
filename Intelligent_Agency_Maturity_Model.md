## Overview

The Intelligent Agency Maturity Model provides a structured framework for assessing an organization's current state and charting a clear path toward becoming an AI-native, agentic enterprise.

This model evaluates **9 core functions** across **5 levels of maturity**, from reactive operations to fully autonomous AI-powered systems.

---

## The Nine Functions

1. **CEO / Strategy**
2. **Product**
3. **Marketing**
4. **Sales**
5. **Accounts / CSM**
6. **Delivery / Operations**
7. **HR / People**
8. **IT**
9. **Finance**

## The Five Maturity Levels

### Level 1: Ad Hoc
**Characteristics**: Reactive, manual, no systematic approach

### Level 2: Functional Foundation
**Characteristics**: Basic systems adopted, foundational metrics tracked

### Level 3: Cross-Functional Alignment
**Characteristics**: Integrated processes, company-wide KPIs, strategic alignment

### Level 4: AI-Augmented Operations
**Characteristics**: Automated insights, predictive analytics, AI-assisted workflows

### Level 5: AI-Native Enterprise
**Characteristics**: Autonomous agents, continuous intelligence, self-optimizing systems

## Using the Maturity Model

### Assessment Process

1. **Evaluate Current State**: Score each function across all 5 levels
2. **Identify Gaps**: Determine which capabilities are missing
3. **Prioritize Advancement**: Focus on functions with highest business impact
4. **Create Roadmap**: Plan progression from current to target state
5. **Measure Progress**: Track advancement over time

### Advancement Strategy

**Not all functions need to advance at the same pace.** Strategic prioritization should consider:

- Business impact of each function
- Current pain points and bottlenecks
- Available resources and budget
- Dependencies between functions
- Quick wins vs. long-term transformation

### Typical Journey

Most organizations follow this progression:

**Year 1**: Level 1 â†’ Level 3 (Foundation & Alignment)  
**Year 2**: Level 3 â†’ Level 4 (AI Augmentation)  
**Year 3**: Level 4 â†’ Level 5 (AI-Native Operations)

---

## Integration with IntelligentOS

The Maturity Model is designed to work seamlessly with:

- **IntelligentOS KPI Architecture**: Each level corresponds to specific KPI capabilities
- **AI Readiness Assessment Framework**: Provides detailed diagnostic for each level
- **Success Model**: Ensures advancement aligns with strategic objectives
- **90-Day Cycles**: Enables rapid, measurable progression through levels

---

## Key Principles

1. **Progress is Non-Linear**: Functions can advance at different rates
2. **Level 3 is the Foundation**: Cross-functional alignment is prerequisite for AI success
3. **AI Without Foundation Fails**: Jumping to Level 4/5 without Levels 2/3 creates risk
4. **Measurement Matters**: Each level requires specific measurement capabilities
5. **Culture Enables Technology**: Technology alone doesn't advance maturity
