## Overview

This document provides a complete, integrated framework for conducting company-wide AI Readiness Assessments, designed to:

1. Evaluate organizational readiness across 8 critical dimensions
2. Populate the Success Model â†’ IOS Config workbook with structured data
3. Support enterprise-wide baseline measurement
4. Enable agentic platform deployment

The framework consists of two parts:
- **Part 1**: AI Readiness Assessment Framework (8 dimensions)
- **Part 2**: Company-Wide Functional Survey Blueprint

---

## PART 1: AI READINESS ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

A complete AI readiness assessment must evaluate the company across 8 dimensions, each mirroring a layer of the Success Model & data structure in the IOS Config.

## PART 2: COMPANY-WIDE FUNCTIONAL SURVEY

**Purpose**: Designed to populate the Success Model â€” IOS Config workbook

The survey is built around the exact structure of the workbook and the 8 functional agents:
- Product
- Marketing
- Sales
- Accounts
- Delivery
- HR
- IT
- Finance

Each section contains short, structured prompts for maximum data completeness and AI usability.

---

## SURVEY BLUEPRINT

One questionnaire per function, with shared core questions.

2. How does your function measure success today?
3. What are your top 3 outcomes for the business?

---

### Section 2: People

1. List all roles in your function.
2. For each role, list responsibilities (bullets ok).
3. Identify key skill gaps related to AI or automation.
4. Are there processes heavily dependent on tribal knowledge?
5. How capable is your team at data-driven decision making? (1â€“5)

---

### Section 3: Processes (Workflows & SOPs)

1. List your top 10 workflows.
2. For each workflow:
