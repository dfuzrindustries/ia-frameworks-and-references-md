## Overview

The Intelligent Agency engagement model provides a structured, gated progression from initial discovery through enterprise-scale transformation. Each phase builds on validated outcomes from the previous phase, ensuring disciplined investment and measurable value realization.

**Purpose**: Define clear engagement phases with success criteria, deliverables, and go/no-go decision points.

**Outcome**: Standardized engagement progression that minimizes risk while maximizing business impact.

---

## The Four-Phase Engagement Model

```
POV Workshop (Day 1)
    ↓ [Go/No-Go Decision]
Proof of Concept (POC)
    ↓ [Go/No-Go Decision]
Pilot Deployment
